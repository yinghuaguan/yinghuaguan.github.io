<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  🎙 I define myself as full stack data scientist. In a nutshell, a full stack
  data scientist is a combination of a data scientist, a software developer and
  a data engineer. I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science from the University of
  British Columbia(UBC) and a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from University of
  California, San Diego(UCSD).
